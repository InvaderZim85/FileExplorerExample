## General
 This is a small Win-Forms application to demonstrate the work with objects and recursion

## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to introduce trainees to the work with objects and recursion.

Win-Forms was chosen because it gives trainees a quick and easy introduction to creating graphical applications. 

## The task
The task for the trainee is to create an application with an interface where the user can select a folder and then the files and subfolders are displayed in a tree (TreeView). If the user clicks on a file / folder, information about it will be displayed, such as the name, the complete path or the creation date.
